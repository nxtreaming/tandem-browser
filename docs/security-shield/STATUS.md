# Security Shield — Implementation Status

> This file tracks progress across Claude Code sessions. Each phase updates its section after completion.
> Read this file FIRST when starting a new session.

## Current State

**Next phase to implement:** Phase 2
**Last completed phase:** Phase 1
**Overall status:** IN PROGRESS

---

## Phase 0: Unified Request Dispatcher

- **Status:** COMPLETED
- **Date:** 2026-02-19
- **Commit:** 126d215
- **Branch:** main
- **Verification:**
  - [x] App launches with `npm start`
  - [x] Normal browsing works
  - [x] Google login works (auth bypass preserved — StealthManager deletes UA for Google domains)
  - [x] Stealth headers applied (StealthManager priority 10 via dispatcher)
  - [x] Network logging works (`/network/log` returns entries, `/network/domains` tracks 13+ domains)
  - [x] WebSocket connections work (WebSocketOriginFix consumer priority 50)
  - [x] Cookies persist (CookieFix consumer priority 10 on response headers)
  - [x] No console errors
  - [x] Late consumer registration works (NetworkInspector registers after attach → triggers reattach)
  - [x] Performance OK (no perceived slowdown, sub-ms dispatch times)
- **Issues encountered:** None
- **Notes for next phase:** Dispatcher is the sole webRequest handler. Register Guardian as priority 1 consumer via `dispatcher.registerBeforeRequest()`. The dispatcher module-level variable is accessible from both `createWindow()` and `startAPI()`.

## Phase 1: Security Core

- **Status:** COMPLETED
- **Date:** 2026-02-19
- **Commit:** 8eea6b5
- **Branch:** main
- **Verification:**
  - [x] shield.db created with correct schema (~/.tandem/security/shield.db, WAL mode)
  - [x] GET /security/status works (guardian status + blocklist stats + DB counts)
  - [x] Blocklist check detects known threats (phishing domains, ad domains correctly blocked)
  - [x] Blocked domain doesn't load (confirmed via blocklist/check API)
  - [x] Normal sites load fine (Google, GitHub, gstatic all work — no false positives)
  - [x] Events logged correctly (block events with timestamps, domain, details JSON)
  - [x] Domains tracked with trust (15 domains tracked after startup, trust levels working)
  - [x] Guardian mode switching works (POST /security/guardian/mode confirmed)
  - [x] NetworkInspector still works (GET /network/log returns entries, /network/domains tracks 13+ domains)
  - [x] Stealth still works (StealthManager priority 10 unaffected)
  - [x] Decision time < 5ms (avg 0.02ms — well under target)
  - [x] No performance degradation (sub-ms dispatch times)
- **Issues encountered:**
  - URLhaus blocklist contains malware URLs hosted on legitimate platforms (github.com, dropbox.com, etc.). Extracting domain-level blocks from these URLs caused false positives for major sites. Fixed by adding `URL_LIST_SAFE_DOMAINS` safelist in NetworkShield to skip hosting platform domains when parsing URL-based blocklists.
- **Notes for next phase:** SecurityManager is initialized in startAPI() via late registration pattern (same as NetworkInspector). Guardian registers as priority 1 on beforeRequest, priority 20 on beforeSendHeaders and headersReceived. All 9 API routes registered under /security/*. Database uses prepared statements for all hot-path queries. OutboundGuard (Phase 2) should register via dispatcher.registerBeforeRequest() with priority 5.
- **Blocklist stats:**
  - URLhaus: 11,806 domains (1,447 hosting platform entries skipped)
  - PhishTank: 728,917 domains
  - Steven Black: 80,916 domains
  - Total unique in memory: 811,812 domains
