## Phase 1: Triviale Safe Fixes

- **Status:** DONE
- **Date:** 2026-02-26
- **Commit:** 4b29320
- **Verification:**
  - [x] `npx tsc --noEmit` — 0 errors (pre-existing errors in gateway test file are OK)
  - [x] Guardian backpressure `&&` → `||` (guardian.ts line 53)
  - [x] SecurityDB closed on quit (security-manager.ts destroy method) — was already present
  - [x] productName changed to "Tandem Browser" (package.json line 47)
  - [x] DEBUG console.logs removed from onboarding (shell/index.html) — 17 lines removed
  - [x] Hardcoded 'levelsio' removed (x-scout.ts line 262)
  - [x] cookieCounts eviction added (guardian.ts)
  - [x] focusByIndex uses listTabs() (tabs/manager.ts line 273)
  - [x] SSE token via header instead of query param (mcp/server.ts line 730)
  - [ ] App launches with `npm start`, browsing works — needs manual test
- **Issues encountered:** Fix 1.2 (SecurityDB close) was already implemented — `this.db.close()` already existed on line 949 of security-manager.ts
- **Notes for next phase:** Phase 2 can start immediately. The `escapeHtml()` function exists at ~line 2568 in shell/index.html. Console.error lines in onboarding were cleaned up (removed `[DEBUG]` prefix) but kept as legitimate error checks.
