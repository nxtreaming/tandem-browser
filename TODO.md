# Tandem Browser TODO

> Internal development backlog for active and upcoming work.
> Historical release summaries belong in `CHANGELOG.md`.
> Architecture and product context belong in `PROJECT.md`.

Last updated: March 14, 2026

## Purpose

- Keep this file forward-looking.
- Track active priorities, maintenance tasks, and unresolved questions.
- Avoid turning this file into a second changelog or a historical roadmap.

## Current Snapshot

- Current app version: `0.57.6`
- The codebase scope is larger than this backlog summary and includes major subsystems such as `sidebar`, `workspaces`, `pinboards`, `sync`, `headless`, and `sessions`.
- Scheduled browsing already exists in baseline form via `WatchManager` and the `/watch/*` API routes.
- Session isolation already exists in baseline form via `SessionManager` and the `/sessions/*` API routes.
- `TODO.md` is the active engineering backlog; `docs/internal/ROADMAP.md` and `docs/internal/STATUS.md` are historical snapshots, not the day-to-day source of truth.

## Current Priorities

### Product Features

- [ ] `WebSocket /watch/live` for live watch updates
- [ ] Expose `captureApplicationScreenshot` and `captureRegionScreenshot` as HTTP API endpoints (e.g. `POST /screenshot/application`, `POST /screenshot/region`) so OpenClaw agents can trigger full-window and region captures programmatically without requiring IPC or human interaction
- [x] Show a notification when the Wingman panel is closed and Wingman replies
- [x] Google Photos upload support for screenshots; local OAuth client ID setup, connect/disconnect flow, and automatic upload path now exist
- [x] Screenshot capture modes for `Web Page`, `Application`, and in-app `Region` selection from the main toolbar screenshot button
- [x] Configurable quick links on the new tab page; links are no longer hardcoded
- [ ] Configurable diff modes for watches beyond SHA-256 hash comparison
- [x] HAR export for the network inspector
- [ ] Design and build the `Personal News` experience; the sidebar currently has a placeholder slot, but the actual panel and feed model are not implemented yet
- [x] Built-in video recorder with Application and Region capture modes, tab audio + mic toggle, MP4 output via ffmpeg; replaces AudioCaptureManager
- [ ] Linux video recorder: implement desktop audio capture via PulseAudio/Pipewire monitor sources; current implementation captures mic audio but not webview/tab audio due to Electron process isolation limitations on Linux

### Maintenance Sweep

- [x] Align public-facing docs, repo metadata, and contribution guidance for a public developer preview
- [x] Reduce the first high-signal GitHub CodeQL security backlog: fix the bearer-token ReDoS, new-tab and OAuth callback XSS paths, URL substring checks in auth/search heuristics, path containment for session/workflow/import/update files, and baseline API rate limiting on the most sensitive flagged routes
- [x] Fix the `Snoze` typo in `docs/research/opera-browser-research.md` and do a quick spell-check in the same tab-snoozing section
- [x] Harden extension update version comparison in `src/extensions/update-checker.ts`; `isNewerVersion()` now handles uneven segment lengths and prerelease suffixes such as `1.2.3-beta`
- [x] Add focused tests for extension version comparison edge cases in `src/extensions/tests/`, including `1.2` vs `1.2.0`, `1.10.0` vs `1.9.9`, and pre-release suffix input

### Codebase Hygiene

- [x] Split `src/main.ts` bootstrap and teardown wiring into dedicated `src/bootstrap/` modules so manager composition stops growing in one file
- [x] Extract the largest shell surfaces out of `shell/index.html` and `shell/css/main.css` so sidebar logic, modal helpers, and stylesheet sections stop living in single inline or monolithic files
- [x] Split the Wingman and ClaroNote renderer surfaces out of `shell/js/main.js` into dedicated shell modules with explicit shared state instead of file-scope coupling
- [x] Extract browser tools (`bookmarks`, `history`, `find`, `voice`, `settings`, `screenshot`) out of `shell/js/main.js` into `shell/js/browser-tools.js` with the shared renderer bridge as the explicit integration surface
- [x] Extract tab rendering, navigation, zoom, and shared renderer state out of `shell/js/main.js` into `shell/js/tabs.js`, and keep active-tab coordination explicit through the renderer bridge
- [x] Extract the draw overlay surface out of `shell/js/main.js` into `shell/js/draw.js` so annotation state, screenshot compositing, and draw-mode lifecycles stop sharing a file with window chrome and shortcuts
- [x] Replace the last mixed shell entrypoint with dedicated `shell/js/window-chrome.js` and `shell/js/shortcut-router.js` modules so `main.js` is no longer needed as a catch-all shell loader
- [ ] Investigate strict Gatekeeper fallback blocking mainstream site scripts when the local agent bridge is unavailable; manual startup checks on March 14, 2026 showed GitHub asset scripts being denied under `strict_low_trust_script`
- [ ] Investigate the remaining 1Password MV3 service-worker startup noise (`DidStartWorkerFail ...: 5` and policy calculation errors) and determine whether it affects any real user-facing behavior; the old `__tandemExtensionHeaders` background error is fixed, and current manual checks indicate the extension still works for normal use
- [x] Add GitHub Actions verification for `npm run verify` on pushes and pull requests

## Later

### Distribution and UX

- [ ] Full multi-profile UX on top or the existing `SessionManager` isolation model
- [ ] Auto-updater integration (`electron-updater`); `release/` still contains an old `0.1.0` manifest
- [ ] Production-ready DMG build for macOS with current naming and metadata
- [ ] AppImage build for Linux
- [ ] Documentation site
- [ ] Firefox import

### Stealth and Browser Fidelity

- [ ] Proxy support (SOCKS5 or HTTP, per-tab or global)
- [ ] User-facing request interception and header rewrite rules
- [ ] TLS / JA3 fingerprint matching
- [ ] Screen resolution spoofing
- [ ] Battery API masking
- [ ] Geolocation spoofing

## Open Questions

- [x] Define what `Agent Tools Phase 4` should be; `docs/agent-tools/STATUS.md` still marks it as the next implementation target — Resolved: Phases 1-3 cover the needed functionality; marked project as COMPLETED
- [x] Define what `Security Fixes Phase 2` should be; `docs/security-fixes/STATUS.md` still leaves this open — Resolved: Phase 1 covers the needed fixes; marked project as COMPLETED

## Recently Completed

- [x] Password manager: local SQLite + AES-256-GCM vault, master password, autofill, password generator, and `GET /passwords/suggest`
- [x] Behavioral learning models: profile compiler, typing timing model, mouse trajectory replay, and fallback humanization behavior
- [x] SPA rendering fix for `/page-content` on dynamic pages; see `docs/archive/plans/spa-rendering-bug.md`
